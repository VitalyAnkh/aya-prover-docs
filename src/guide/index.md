Aya is a programming language _and_ an interactive proof assistant designed for type-directed programming _and_ formalizing math.

The type system of Aya has the following highlights:

+ Set-level cubical features so `funExt` and quotients are available without axioms (like [Agda], [redtt], and [Arend] but not higher-dimensional),
+ Overlapping and order-independent pattern matching makes simple functions compute better,
+ Practical functional programming features similar to [Haskell] and [Idris]: dependent pattern matching, typed holes, enchanted synthesis of implicit arguments.

The implementation of the Aya compiler has the following highlights:

+ Efficient type checking by JIT-compiling well-typed definitions to JVM higher-order abstract syntax, so substitution does not traverse terms,
+ Convenient interactive tools such as a language server for VSCode, a REPL, and hyperlinked document generation ([demo](../blog/tt-in-tt-qiit)),
+ Pre-compiled binary release.
